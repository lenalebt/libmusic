         * @param fs the sampling frequency of the audio data that will be processed in Hz (typically 22050 Hz)
         * @param lowpassFilter a lowpassfilter that will be applied during the process. Make sure that this filter has a cutoff frequency of fs/2.

         * @param threshold values in the CQT kernel smaller than this value will be vanished. use a larger value to gain accuracy, or a smaller value to gain speed.
