 * @page midinote_scale Midi note scale
 * To identify a musical note, the midi note scale ist used. Midi notes are just
 * semitones one after each other.
 * 
 * - The lowest note on a piano with 88 keys
 * is A0, which corresponds to midi note <code>21</code> (<code>0x15</code>).
 * In Germany, this note is called A''.
 * 
 * - The note for standard pitch of 440Hz is
 * A4, a' or midi note <code>69</code> (<code>0x55</code>).
 * 
 * - The lowest midi note is
 * <code>0</code> (<code>0x00</code>), which corresponds to C-1 or C''''.
 * 
 * - The highest midi note is
 * <code>127</code> (<code>0x7F</code>), which is G9 or g'''''.
