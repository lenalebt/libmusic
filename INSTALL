Install
=======

Prequisites
===========

To install the library, you need to install some other libraries and tools:

doxygen, if you want to build the documentation. This package is optional.
cmake, which is the build system and needed to compile the software.
libmusicaccess, which should be bundled or found at the same place you found libmusic.
eigen >= 3.0, this library is used for matrix and vector operations.
sqlite3, which is the database backend.
Installing on a normal *nix system

If you want to install the library in a normal, non-cross-compile-environment, just go to the "build/" directory and type

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j5
make install
The last step might require root privileges. If you want to build the docs and have doxygen installed, type

make doc
in the very same directory. You will find the docs in the api-doc/ directory. There are two formats available, for the more common HTML version open the file api-doc/html/index.html. The LaTeX version needs to be compiled, which is possible via

cd api-doc/latex/
pdflatex refman.tex
pdflatex refman.tex
if you have LaTeX installed. Running LaTeX twice is necessary to get cross-references and some citations right. If you don't care about them, a single run is sufficient. You may now open the file refman.pdf with a PDF reader of your choice..

Installing for Cross-Compilation
================================

If you want to cross-compile and install the library, you need to 
build the library with a cmake toolchain file and afterwards copy 
the files manually to the right directories. This step highly 
depends on the environment you are using.

Example: Blackberry Playbook NDK 2.0.1

Assuming you installed the NDK in "/opt/bbndk-2.0.1/", you need to:
- build the library:
    * go to the "build/" directory. Type:
        cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/modules/Toolchain-QNX-6.5.0-armv7.cmake ..
        make -j4
- copy the file "libmusic.so" to "/opt/bbndk-2.0.1/target/qnx6/armle-v7/usr/lib"
//TODO: - copy all header files (*.hpp) from the "../src/" directory to 
  "/opt/bbndk-2.0.1/target/qnx6/usr/include". Also copy the headers 
  in the subdirectories!

All libraries depending on this library should now be able to find it.
