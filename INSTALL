Installing the library
======================

If you want to install the library in a normal, 
non-cross-compile-environment, just go to the "build/" directory and 
type

cmake ..
make -j5
make install

The last step might require root privileges. If you want to build 
the docs, type

make doc

in the very same directory. You will find the docs in the api-doc/ 
directory. There are two formats available, for the more common HTML 
version open the file api-doc/html/index.html .

Installing for Cross-Compilation
================================

If you want to cross-compile and install the library, you need to 
build the library with a cmake toolchain file and afterwards copy 
the files manually to the right directories. This step highly 
depends on the environment you are using.

Example: Blackberry Playbook NDK 2.0.1

Assuming you installed the NDK in "/opt/bbndk-2.0.1/", you need to:
- build the library:
    * go to the "build/" directory. Type:
        cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/modules/Toolchain-QNX-6.5.0-armv7.cmake ..
        make -j4
- copy the file "libmusic.so" to "/opt/bbndk-2.0.1/target/qnx6/armle-v7/usr/lib"
//TODO: - copy all header files (*.hpp) from the "../src/" directory to 
  "/opt/bbndk-2.0.1/target/qnx6/usr/include". Also copy the headers 
  in the subdirectories!

All libraries depending on this library should now be able to find it.
